# Cyclistic
This project served as the capstone of the Google Data Analytics Course on Coursera. Presented below is an overview of the project, along with the accompanying notebook attached for reference.


**Introduction**



In 2016, Cyclistic successfully introduced a bike-sharing program, which has since expanded to include 5,824 bicycles geotracked and stationed at 692 locations throughout Chicago. These bikes can be conveniently unlocked from one station and returned to any other station within the network at any time. Cyclistic's marketing approach, until now, focused on building general awareness and appealing to a broad range of consumers. This was made feasible by the flexible pricing plans offered, including single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships.
Customers who opt for single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as "casual riders," while those who purchase annual memberships are recognized as "Cyclistic members." Financial analysis has shown that Cyclistic members generate significantly higher profits compared to casual riders. Despite the effectiveness of flexible pricing in attracting more customers, Moreno, the head of marketing, believes that the key to future growth lies in maximizing the number of annual members. Instead of launching a new marketing campaign targeting entirely new customers, Moreno sees a valuable opportunity to convert casual riders into annual members. She points out that casual riders are already familiar with Cyclistic and have chosen the service for their transportation needs.
With a clear goal in mind, Moreno aims to develop marketing strategies that focus on converting casual riders into annual members. To accomplish this, the marketing analyst team needs a deeper understanding of the distinctions between annual members and casual riders, the motivations behind casual riders purchasing memberships, and the potential impact of digital media on their marketing tactics. Moreno and her team are keen to analyze Cyclistic's historical bike trip data to uncover meaningful trends that can inform their strategies.
